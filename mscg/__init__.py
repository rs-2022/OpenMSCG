'''the mscg package provides a toolkit of data structures and API 
functions, which can be used to build up a customized or extended 
workflow of multi-scale coarse-graining modeling in Python. These
APIs are designed with object-oriented programming paradigm and
organized in sub-packages and modules. To use these APIs, simply
load the package in a Python script: ::
    
    >>> import mscg as cg
    >>> help(cg)

or, directly import sub-packages and modules into current 
namespace: ::

    >>> from mscg import *
