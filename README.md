# OpenMSCG

An open-source python package for systematic coarse-graining (including
MSCG/force-matching) in computational chemistry and biology. To download OpenMSCG integrated with the mstool backmapping software, visit here: https://software.rcc.uchicago.edu/git/MSCG/mscg-mstool.

## Quick Guide

**1. Prerequisites**

Install a conda package manager/environment: `Anaconda` or `Miniconda`.

**2. Install package from Anaconda Cloud**

```
conda install -c vothgroup openmscg
```

**4. Test the installation**

```
