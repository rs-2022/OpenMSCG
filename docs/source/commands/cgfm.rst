Notes
-----

* The script ``cgfm`` doesn't dump the force or coefficient table in the plain-text format. Instead, there are two binary output files (`they are pickle files <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_),  named by the option ``--save``. By default, they are named *covariance_matrix.p* and *coeffs_matrix.p*.

  * **covariance_matrix.p** stores the covariance matrix for the regression problem before solving it. It can be used as intermediate results for debugging or other purposes.

  * **coeffs_matrix.p** stores the coefficients of the model for each force table after solving the regression problem. Users can use the command `cgdump <cgdump.html>`_ to dump the readable force tables from it.
  
* If this command is `called with in another Python script <../commands.html#call-command-in-python>`_, users may want to access these results directly. In this case, users can pass the value *"return"* to the ``--save`` argument and the coefficient matrix will be returned to the wrapper script as lists. For example::
    
    coeffs = cgfm.main(
        top     = datafile("unary_lj_fluid.top"),
        traj    = datafile("unary_lj_fluid.lammpstrj,frames=20"),
        cut     = 2.50,
        pair    = ['model=BSpline,type=1:1,min=0.9,max=2.50,resolution=0.1'],
        save    = 'return'
    )

* Read `Ridge Regression (regularization) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression>`_ for more information about the Ridge model.

* Read the article `A Bayesian statistics approach to multiscale coarse graining <https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.3033218>`_ for more information about this approach.

* If you have used the old ``MSCGFM`` software, this command is a replacement to the ``newfm`` command in ``MSCGFM``.

Ultra Coarse-Graining
---------------------

Ultra Coarse-Graining (UCG) is a methodology that allows chemical and environmental changes to be captured by modulating the interactions between coarse-grained sites (often as a function of their environment). In a UCG model, the CG sites can comprised of multiple types depending on its surroundings. This algorithm is useful when the group of atoms in a CG site acts differently in different chemical environments. The current implementation primarily support rapid local equilibrium UCG.

The option ``--ucg`` defines the parameters to control the UCG scheme using a comma separated string with the following ``key=value`` fields:

  * ``replica=N``, the number of replica to be spawned from a CG frame.
  * ``seed=N``, the random seed for spawning states.

The option ``--ucg-wf`` defines the weighting functions that's used to calculate the probabilities of states for a CG type. It is also a comma separated string starting with the weighting function name following by a group of ``key=value`` fields. For example:


  * A sample rapid methanol model: ``--ucg-wf RLE,I=MeOH,J=MeOH,high=Near,low=Far,rth=4.5,wth=3.5``

     * I,J=[name], the name of the targeted CG type for pairs of I and J to spawn.
     * high=[name],low=[name], the names of the CG types representing sites of high or low local densities.
     * rth=[float],wth=[float], the two parameters in the UCG model used to calculate local coordination numbers.
